        <p> 
            I grew up in 8 cities in 4 countries. Seattle is where I have lived the longest, which is 14 years. I love to travel and have visited 35 countries! <br><br>

            I earned my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in Chemical Engineering from the University of Southern California. It was the height of the dot.com era and I worked in that industry for 2 years until the bubble burst. After that, there was a period of time where tech jobs were few and far between, so I looked in a new career direction. <br><br>

            Swimming was always something I enjoyed and spent 12 years on swim teams growing up. It is still my favorite sport. I spent some time teaching middle school and high school and coached the swim team there. Then I had a bad accident!<br><br>

            I was sent to physcial therapy and was very inspired by my PT! I went back and earned my Doctorate in Physical Therapy from the University of St. Agustine in St. Agustine, Florida.<br><br>

            After graduation, I moved to Seattle and adopted my cat Pinot from the shelter. I worked as a Physical Therapist for other clinics for 4 years before opening my own practice in January 2011. I also continued teaching, but this time taught adults. I taught for 10 years at an Acupuncture school and taught continuing education all over the country for 5 years, while I practiced Physical Therapy.<br><br> 

            Life took a new direction in 2012 when my first child was born, a sweet, intelligent and inquisitve boy. Being a Mom changed by life in ways I could never have imagined! In 2014, I had another baby, a creative, energetic boy with a great sense of humor.<br><br>

            Then life took a new direction again. In 2018, I became a single mom. It became really taxing to take care of patients all day at work and then go home and take care of two young kids. I also realized that I wanted a career that allowed me to reach a larger population and Physical Therapy only allowed me to connect with those who already had injuries. While I still like health and wellness, I am really excited to move back into tech and do something that allows me to connect with a larger subset of the general population.
